# EnzoBot Contribution Guide
I am very picky about quality of code in EnzoBot so it is *very* important that you follow these guidelines when contributing.

### Big Dos and Don'ts
 - Don't PR single line corrections
 - Always test your code the best you can **BEFORE** contributing
 - Don't change code just to reorganise or to restructure without making sure it has a worthwhile purpose
 - Do use separate branches for features requiring more than 10 commits

**I highly recommend that you use IntelliJ for contributions as I will not accept any files or gitignores concerning Eclipse. *I do not provide any help for people using Eclipse!***
### Formatting
 I mostly use IntelliJ's default formatter with a few changes:
 - The minimum gap between the class header and body is 1 line
 - There are to be no breaks larger than 3 lines in your contribution
 - A line break must occur after a newline escape character in strings. IntelliJ should handle this if you keep your cursor within the quotation marks after the escape character and press `Enter`

and thats pretty much the end of this **Woo Hoo** but i may add more in the future thanks for reading.
